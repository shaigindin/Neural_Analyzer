plot_acurracy_comparision(one: str, two: str) -
    This method receives two paths for two data files, 
    and plots the data in a way that the x-axis is the accuracy of the 
    samples in the first file (one), and the y-axis is the accuracy of the 
    samples in the second file (two).
    **EXAMPLE** :  plot_acurracy_comparision("/data_dir/SNR", "/data_dir/CRB")    


plot_fragments(files: List[str], concat = List[int]) -
    This method receives a list of files (files), and the number of concatenated cells to
    show (concat).
    And it plots the framents graph for each population it finds in the dir.
    **EXAMPLE** : plot_fragments(['/data_dir/fragments/'], [1, 10, 20, 30])

def plot_histogram(files: List[str] = None) - 
    This method receives a list of data files, and prints the histogram of each data file.
    **EXMAPLE** : plot_histogram(['/data_dir'])

plot_acc_over_concat_cells(files: Tuple[List[str]] = None, number_of_concat_cells: int = 100, ticks: int = 1) -
    Drawing a graphs of accuracies over number of concatenated cells, of all the populations selected.
     and of all of the experiment types.
    It hase three arguments files - which is a list of data files,
                            number_of_concat_cells - which is the number of concated cells to show
                            ticks - number of ticks on the x-axis.
    **EXAMPLE** : plot_acc_over_concat_cells((['data_files/SNR','data_files/CRB'],), 50, 1)

    important : the input is tuple of folders : (folder1,folder2,...)
    it will print all the folders garph by graph together in the same image for example
    calling the function
    plot_acc_over_concat_cells( (['out/pursuit/simple_knn'], ['out/saccade//simple_knn')] )  )
    will print two graphs, side by side of all the population in pursuit and in the other graph
    will print all the population of saccade

    if you want to print only the pursuit graph folder
    do the command:
    plot_acc_over_concat_cells( (['out/pursuit/simple_knn'],) )

    if you want to print only snr and crb from pursuit
    do the command
    plot_acc_over_concat_cells(['out/pursuit/simple_knn/SNR','out/pursuit/simple_knn/SNR'])
