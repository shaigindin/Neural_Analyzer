Instructions:
preparations
first you need to convert matlab files to csv. in order to do so,
arrange in input folder as such:
input_folder -> project_name : for example "Noga"

PAY ATTENTION - all the matlab file names has to be in this matter population name in CAPITAL letters underscore name of cell
for example CS_4985.mat or MSN _4547.mat.

now, you can create an instance of decoder, for example:

decode = decoder("/cs/usr/shai.gindin/MATY/Neural_Analyzer/in",
                    "/cs/usr/shai.gindin/MATY/Neural_Analyzer/out",
                    ['MSN','SNR','CRB','CS','SS'])

it means that this decoder will convert snr msn and crb files only.



now to convert matlab to csv call the convert_matlab_to_csv function for example:
a.convert_matlab_to_csv("cue")

to the folder "/cs/usr/shai.gindin/MATY/Neural_Analyzer/out/csv_files/cue"

if you want to add another popultaion for exanple 'tan', you can press the following command:
a.population_names.append("tan")

after finished prepations,
you can run the algorithm

if you want to run for example, the knn algorithm on the the cue experiment on the pursuit  and the sacade with
the ['MSN','SNR','CRB','CS','SS'] populations do the following command:

a.analyze("cue", lag=500, segments_size = 7) - it means it will cut from 500 ms to 1200ms
and than choose the folders
and than choose the simple knn

if you want to apply the simple knn on the the popultaion just write the commands

a.analyze("cue", lag=1000, segments_size = 6) - because in the cue trials there are only 1600ms

now make new project with 2200 ms trials
a.convert_matlab_to_csv("project_with_matlab_files_with_2200ms_trials")

now lets analyze simple knn only on SNR and MSN
a.population_names  = ['SNR','MSN']
a.analyze("project_with_matlab_files_with_2200ms_trials") - because the defauls parametes is  2200ms
and than follow the commands


remarks**
each time you will run one of the algorithm it will ask you with dependent value you want.
in option are from you matlab file you created. it means that in the matlab file the program
will search for all the vectors and its name



#set the population names
a.population_names  = ['CRB']
